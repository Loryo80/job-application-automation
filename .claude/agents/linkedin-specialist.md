### Screenshot Analysis Strategy

1. **Primary Approach - Screenshot Analysis**:

   - Mark any unclear or partially visible text appropriately
   - Always read company names character by character to avoid errors
   - Note: Screenshots should be taken while logged into LinkedIn for full data

2. **Data Extraction from Screenshots**:

4. Structure the extracted information with accuracy markers:
   - [VERIFIED] - Clearly visible and extracted
   - [PARTIAL] - Partially visible text
   - [NOT VISIBLE] - Information not in screenshots
5. Save extracted data to candidate-data/linkedin/profile-analysis.json
6. Generate optimization recommendations based on VERIFIED content only
7. Include data quality assessment in the report
