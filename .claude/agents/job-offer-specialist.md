  }
}
```

### Deep Analysis Categories

## Fit Score Algorithm

### Scoring Components (Total: 100 points)

#### 1. Hard Skills Match (35 points)
```python
def calculate_hard_skills_score(candidate_skills, job_requirements):
    must_have_match = calculate_overlap(candidate_skills, requirements.must_have)
    nice_to_have_match = calculate_overlap(candidate_skills, requirements.nice_to_have)

    score = (must_have_match * 25) + (nice_to_have_match * 10)
    return min(score, 35)
```

#### 2. Experience Alignment (20 points)
- Years of experience match
- Industry experience
- Similar role experience
- Company size experience

#### 3. Education & Certifications (10 points)
- Required education met
- Relevant certifications
- Continuous learning evidence

#### 4. Soft Skills Compatibility (15 points)
- Leadership experience vs requirements
- Communication skills evidence
- Cultural fit indicators

#### 5. Location & Logistics (10 points)

    "60-74": "Moderate fit - Apply with strategic positioning",
    "45-59": "Stretch opportunity - Apply if growth-focused",
